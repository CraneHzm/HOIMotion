## Code to process the MoGaze dataset


## Usage:
Step 1: Download the dataset at https://humans-to-robots-motion.github.io/mogaze/.

Step 2: Set 'dataset_path' and 'dataset_processed_path' in 'mogaze_preprocessing.py' and run it to process the dataset.

Step 3: It is optional but highly recommended to set 'data_path' in 'dataset_visualisation.py' to visualise and get familiar with the dataset.
